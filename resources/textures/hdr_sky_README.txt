Asset License
All assets (HDRIs, textures and 3D models) on this site are the original work of Poly Haven staff, or artists who willingly and directly donate/sell their work to Poly Haven.

Our assets are all licensed as CC0, which is effectively Public Domain even in jurisdictions that do not support the Public Domain.

Here's an excerpt from the CC0 FAQ page to clarify:

Once the creator or a subsequent owner of a work applies CC0 to a work, the work is no longer his or hers in any meaningful sense under copyright law. Anyone can then use the work in any way and for any purpose, including commercial purposes [...] Think of CC0 as the "no rights reserved" option. CC0 is a useful tool for clarifying that you do not claim copyright in a work anywhere in the world.
In other words:

You can use our assets for any purpose, including commercial work.
You do not need to give credit or attribution when using them (although it is appreciated).
You can redistribute them, share them around, include them when sharing your own work, or even in a product you sell.
