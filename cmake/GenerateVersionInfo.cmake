# GenerateVersionInfo
# ===================
#
# This script generates an output file from a given input template by filling in the version
# information provided in the following variables
#
#  * BUILD_DEV_VERSION
#  * BUILD_CUSTOM_VERSION
#  * CUSTOM_VERSION
#
# The git executable is expected to be specified in
#
#  * GIT_EXECUTABLE
#
# The input template and the output file destination are defined via
#
#  * VERSION_FILE_INPUT
#  * VERSION_FILE_OUTPUT
#
# This implementation was inspired by
# https://github.com/minetest/minetest/blob/master/cmake/Modules/GenerateVersion.cmake
