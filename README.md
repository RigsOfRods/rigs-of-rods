## Community Mods

### Where to get mods (AKA "resources", "content," etc)

Rigs of Rods, by default, includes only a small selection of built-in content. Most vehicles, terrains, and other additions are provided as user-generated mods available through the **[official Rigs of Rods repository](https://forum.rigsofrods.org/resources/)**. These community-created assets are separate from the core project and are not covered under the project's license, as they are contributed and licensed by their individual creators. As such, they will never be included with the game by default.

As of Rigs of Rods version 2022.04, resources can be installed from within the game itself. **[Read the Guide to Installing Mods](https://docs.rigsofrods.org/gameplay/installing-content/)**.

### How to create your own mods

Creating mods for Rigs of Rods can be a challenging yet highly rewarding experience. While it may take time to learn the tools, formats, and techniques involved, the [official documentation](https://docs.rigsofrods.org) provides step-by-step guidance to help you get started. The community is also active and welcoming, through the community forums, community Discord server, and other resources where you can ask questions and share your progress.
