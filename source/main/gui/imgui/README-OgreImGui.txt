# Ogre Binding for IMGUI #

This is a raw Ogre binding for Imgui. No project/cmake file, no demo, just four source files, because If you're familiar with Ogre, integration should be pretty straightforward.

## Dependencies ##

* Ogre
* IMGUI
* OIS

## Compatibility ##

This binding is compatible with both Ogre 1.x and 2.0.
Render systems supported are:

* D3D9
* D3D11
* GL3+

## Usage ##

### Compiling ###

Simply copy the files somewhere in your project or in your imgui project. include paths needed are:

* OgreMain/include
* OIS
* Boost if you are using it as Ogre thread provider

### Integration ###

Create and init the ImguiManager after your Ogre init:
```
ImguiManager::createSingleton();
ImguiManager::getSingleton().init(mSceneMgr,mOISKeyboardInput,mOISMouseInput);
```
Then in your render loop:
```
ImguiManager::getSingleton().newFrame(getDeltaTime(), Ogre::Rect(0,0,_getRenderWindow()->getWidth(),_getRenderWindow()->getHeight()));
```
And voil√† !

You can then use imgui just like you want.

#### Note ####

You'll also need to transfer input events from your OIS Input listener to the Imgui manager.
For example:
```
bool MyInputManager::mouseMoved( const OIS::MouseEvent &arg )
{
    Ogre::ImguiManager::getSingleton().mouseMoved(arg);
}
```
