\section A Introduction
Although the PagedGeometry engine is fairly simple and easy to use, there are some
advanced features that may be difficult to learn on you own. This API reference is here
for your convenience, to aid you in learning how to get the most out of the PagedGeometry
engine.

Every feature of the engine is covered here in detail, so you won't be left in the dark
about any aspect of PagedGeometry's use (however, some of the internal workings of the
engine are not documented in here - you'll have to refer to the source code comments
for that).


\section B What is PagedGeometry?
The PagedGeometry engine is an add-on to the <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org">OGRE
Graphics Engine</a>, which provides highly optimized methods for rendering massive amounts
of small meshes covering a possibly infinite area. This is especially well suited for dense
forests and outdoor scenes, with millions of trees, bushes, grass, rocks, etc., etc.

Paged geometry gives you many advantages over plain entities, the main one being speed:
With proper usage of detail levels, outdoor scenes managed by PagedGeometry can
be >100x faster than plain entities. Another advantage is that the geometry is paged; in
other words, only entities which are immediately needed (to be displayed) are loaded.
This allows you to expand the boundaries of your virtual world almost infinitely
(only limited by floating point precision), providing the player with a more realistically
scaled game area.


\section C Getting Started

The first thing you should do is follow the instructions in "Getting Started.txt" to
get PagedGeometry compiled and the examples running. Note: Keep in mind that the art
in the examples is not the best, and is there simply to demonstrate the performance of
the engine.

When you're ready to start learning how to use PagedGeometry, the best place to start is
with Tutorial 1 (in the docs folder). The tutorials will teach you how to use many
important PagedGeometry features, step by step. This API reference isn't recommended
for learning, but is a valuable resource when you need specific in-depth information
about a certain function or class.

/**
\brief A class providing highly optimized methods for rendering massive amounts of geometry.

The PagedGeometry class provides highly optimized methods for rendering massive amounts
of small meshes, covering a large area. This is especially well suited for dense
forests, with thousands of trees, bushes, grass, rocks, etc., etc.

The paged geometry works by loading only the geometry that is visible (or will soon
be visible), to save memory. The PagedGeometry engine can display entities using many
different methods (static geometry, impostors, etc.) What method is used depends on the
entities' distance from the camera, and how you configured these methods (see
PagedGeometry::addDetailLevel() for more info about this).

The loading of pages is done through a PageLoader, which you define. This way, you
can program the PagedGeometry to load pages any way you want, whether it's from a
file on your hard drive, from a procedural generation algorithm, or anything else.
See the documentation for the PageLoader class for more information about this.

\note Always remember to call each PagedGeometry object's update() function every
frame; otherwise the geometry you're trying to display will not appear correctly.
See PagedGeometry::update() for more information.

	have to use this function to configure PagedGeometry to use that coordinate system; otherwise,
	LOD calculations, impostors, etc. will be all messed up.

	To do so, simply supply which directions you consider "right" and "up". For example, if your
	coordinate system uses X as right, Y as forward, and Z as up, you would set the "right" parameter
	to Vector3::UNIT_X and the "up" parameter to Vector3::UNIT_Z. The forward direction
	(Vector3::UNIT_Y in this case) doesn't need to be supplied since it will be automatically calculated

	a strict boundary can improve performance.

	When bounded mode is used, PagedGeometry allocates certain lightweight data
	structures to fill the boundaries. This may result in a slight frame rate boost
	compared to an infinite world, although it will take a little more memory
	(especially with large areas).

	Since bounded mode requires more memory for larger boundaries, it is best suited

	by calling this function if not already activated (it will be by default).

	Most game worlds have boundaries of some sort, but infinite mode allows you to
	expand the size of your game world almost to infinity. Since only what's on the
	screen is actually loaded, it makes little difference if your world is 100 square
	miles, or 1,000,000 square miles.

	The only disadvantage to using infinite mode is that cache efficiency will be
	slightly reduced in some cases. For example, bounded mode will achieve better

	is more globally based (unlike the locally based cache of infinite mode).

	/**
	\brief Adds a detail level to the PagedGeometry object.
	\param PageType The page type class you want to use for this detail level.
	\param maxRange The maximum distance this detail level will be used at.
	\param transitionLength The desired length of fade transitions - optional
	\param data An extra parameter to pass to the PageType constructor - optional

	\note PageType is not really a function parameter, but a template parameter.
	See the code below for an example on how this "parameter" is used.

	On it's own, a plain PagedGeometry object can't display anything. It needs you
	to add detail levels to it with this function. This way, you can easily customize
	the behavior of the PagedGeometry.

	To use this function, simply use the form:

	\code
	pagedGeometry::addDetailLevel<PageType>(farRange);
	\endcode

	In the above example, "farRange" specifies the maximum view distance this detail
	level will be used at. However, the most important part is "<PageType>". Here you
	substitute "PageType" with the name of a installed page type you want to use for
	this detail level. A page type is simply a method of displaying or otherwise
	representing entities.

	The PagedGeometry engine currently comes pre-installed with a few page types:
	BatchPage and ImpostorPage. Refer to their class documentation for detailed
	information about them (although you never actually access these classes yourself).

	You can use these page types in any configuration you want. For example:

	\code
	pagedTrees->addDetailLevel<BatchPage>(100); //Use batched geometry from 0-100
	pagedTrees->addDetailLevel<ImpostorPage>(500); //Use impostors from 100-500
	\endcode

	That example would set up the PagedGeometry object called pagedTrees to use
	batched geometry (StaticGeometry) from 0 to 100 units from the camera, and impostors
	from 100 to 500 units from the camera.

	If the included page types aren't adequate, you can fairly easily add your own
	by simply extending the virtual GeometryPage class properly.

	By default, no fade transitions are used. This means that there will be a noticeable
	"popping" effect when your tree changes from an impostor to a batch, for example.
	Enabling fade transitions will smooth out the change by slowly "morphing" between
	the two detail levels. To enable fade transitions, simply add a second parameter to
	you addDetailLevel() call:

	\code
	//Use batched geometry from 0-100, and transition to the next LOD for 50 units
	pagedTrees->addDetailLevel<BatchPage>(100, 50);
	//Use impostors from 100-500
	pagedTrees->addDetailLevel<ImpostorPage>(500);
	\endcode

	The second parameter seen above will enable transitions between BatchPage and the next
	LOD (which is ImpostorPage, in this case). The number you supply will specify how long
	the transition is. Longer transitions result in smoother "morphs", although shorter
	transitions will give slightly better frame rates.

	The transition parameter can also be applied to the last detail level to cause it to fade out:

	\code
	//Use batched geometry from 0-100, and transition to the next LOD for 50 units
	pagedTrees->addDetailLevel<BatchPage>(100, 50);
	//Use impostors from 100-400, and fade out for 100 units beyond that
	pagedTrees->addDetailLevel<ImpostorPage>(400, 100);
	\endcode

	In the example above, batching is used up to 100 units, where the batched geometry
	starts transitioning for 50 units into the next level of detail (impostors). The
	impostors continue up to 400 units, where they begin to fade out for 100 more units.

	\warning Depending on your page size and transition length, enabling fade transitions
	will often reduce PagedGeometry's rendering performance anywhere from 10 - 30%.

	Transitions can be disabled by omitting the transitionLength parameter, or setting
	it to 0.

	\note Make sure you make any calls to setPageSize() and setBounds() / setInfinite()
	before adding detail levels with this function. After a detail level is added you
	cannot call these functions without first removing them with removeDetailLevels().

	The "data" parameter is entirely optional, so there should never be any requirement that it
	be used. Just what type of data this parameter accepts, and what it does, depends entirely
	on the specific GeometryPage implementation you're using. See the appropriate page type
	documentation for info on how this parameter can be used (if at all).

	\see The GeometryPage class documention for more information on adding custom
	page types.

/**
\brief This base-class can be extended to provide different ways of representing entities.

The PagedGeometry engine comes pre-installed with a few GeometryPage sub-classes
(BatchPage, and ImpostorPage). These "page types" can all be supplied to
a PagedGeometry object through addDetailLevel().
\see PagedGeometry::addDetailLevel() for more information about setting up detail levels.

If you need more than the pre-installed page types, you can easily create your own!
Simply make a new class inheriting GeometryPage. Then implement the necessary member
functions, and it should work immediately. No additional setup is required.

There are several virtual member functions you will need to implement in your class:
\code
virtual void init(SceneManager *mgr, Camera *cam) = 0;
virtual void setRegion(Real left, Real top, Real right, Real bottom) = 0;
virtual void addEntity(Entity *ent, const Vector3 &position, const Quaternion &rotation, const Vector3 &scale, const Ogre::ColourValue &color, void* userData = NULL) = 0;
virtual void build() {}
virtual void removeEntities() = 0;
virtual void setVisible(bool visible) = 0;
virtual void setFade(bool enabled, Real visibleDist, Real invisibleDist) = 0;
virtual void update() {}
\endcode

\note For detailed information on implementing each of these functions, please refer to
their documentation.

Here is how the page manager uses these functions:

\b 1. When a PagedGeometry first creates a GeometryPage, it immediately calls
GeometryPage::init(). This function is called just like a constructor, and you should
use it the same way.

\b 2. GeometryPage::setRegion() is called to provide you with the area where upcoming
entities will be added. You can use this information any way you like, or you can omit
this step completely by omitting the setRegion() function from your class definition.

\b 3. To load a page, the addEntity() function is used to insert all the entities into the scene.
Then, build() is called. Entities don't actually have to be displayed until after build()
is called.

\b 4. setVisible() and setFade() will be called occasionally to update the visibility/fade status
of the page.

\b 5. When the page has become obsolete, the contents of it is deleted with removeEntities().
This should return the page to the state it was before addEntity() and build().

\b 6. Steps 2-5 are repeated as pages are loaded/unloaded

Implementing your own geometry page is really very simple. As long as the functions
do their jobs right, everything will work fine. If you learn best be example, you may
want to take a look at how the included page types are implemented also.

\see The BatchPage or GrassPage code for examples of how page types are implemented (the
ImpostorPage can also be used as an example, although it is a somewhat complex technique,
and is not recommended for learning how GeometryPage's work).

\brief A class which you extend to provide a callback function for loading entities.

\note PagedGeometry comes pre-installed with several PageLoader classes, so you probably
won't need to create you're own from scratch. See TreeLoader2D, TreeLoader3D, and GrassLoader
for more info.

Unlike most entity managers, PagedGeometry does not allow you to simply add all your
entities to the object, and let the engine run from that point on. Since the
PagedGeometry engine is designed to work with extremely large game areas, preloading
everything would take far too much memory. Instead, it pages the geometry. In other
words, it loads the geometry only as needed.

Whenever the engine needs a specific region of geometry to be loaded, it calls on your
page loader class's loadPage() function. It's completely up to you how this function
loads the entities, just as long as it gets the job done. When loadPage() is called,
you are provided with a PageInfo variable, which specifies the boundary which must
be loaded (in addition to other useful info). Make sure you don't add anything outside
of this boundary, otherwise the results may be unpredictable.

Within loadPage(), you add entities by calling addEntity(). Simply supply the entity
you want to add (you can add the same entity as many times as you want - in fact, you
should do this as much as possible for better performance), and it's position, rotation,
and scale (optional).

Note that your page loader may be asked to load an area which is out of your world's
bounds (if you have any). In this case simply return without adding any entities.

To set up a page loader, just make a new sub-class (call it anything you want) of
PageLoader. Your class must have one function:

\code
void loadPage(const PageInfo &page);
\endcode

Make sure you get the declaration right, otherwise it won't compile. The rest is up to
you. You can define your own member functions if that helps, just as long as your
loadPage() function does it's job right.

Once you've created your PageLoader-derived class, you need to attach it to a
PagedGeometry object. To do this, simply create an instance of your class, and call

\code
pagedGeometry->setPageLoader(yourPageLoader);
\endcode

Remember: If you ever delete a PagedGeometry object, you will have to delete your page
loader yourself (if you want to). The PagedGeometry destructor won't do this for you.

	\param maxCacheInterval The maximum period of time (milliseconds) before another page is loaded.
	\param inactivePageLife The maximum period of time (milliseconds) a inactive (invisible) page
	is allowed to stay loaded.

	The GeometryPageManager automatically determines how fast pages should be cached to keep
	everything running as smooth as possible, but there are a few options that are adjustable.
	This function allows you to adjust these variables to fine-tune cache performance.

	The maxCacheInterval is basically a minimum rate at which pages are cached. Normally, a stopped
	camera would cause the cache rate prediction algorithm to say 0 pages-per-second must be cached.
	However, this is not optimal, since idle time should be taken advantage of to finish loading.
	By adjusting this value, you can set how much caching you want going on when the camera is
	stopped or moving very slowly.

	The inactivePageLife allows you to set how long inactive pages remain in memory. An inactive page
	is one that is out of the cache range and may not be immediately needed. By allowing these pages
	to remain in memory for a short period of time, the camera can return to it's previous position
	with no need to reload anything.

	\note Even with large inactivePageLife values, pages may be unloaded if the camera moves far enough
	from them, so setting extremely high inactivePageLife values won't result in massive memory usage.
