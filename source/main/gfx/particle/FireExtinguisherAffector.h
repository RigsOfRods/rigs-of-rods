		This affector (see ParticleAffector) offers a simple (and inaccurate) physical deflection.
		All particles which hit the plane are reflected.
	@par
		The plane is defined by a point (plane_point) and the normal (plane_normal).
		In addition it is possible to change the strenght of the recoil by using the bounce parameter.
