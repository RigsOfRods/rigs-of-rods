 * \author Georgy Yunaev
 * \version 1.0
 * \date 09.2004
 * \brief This file defines all prototypes and functions to use libircclient.
 *
 * libircclient is a small but powerful library, which implements client-server IRC
 * protocol. It is designed to be small, fast, portable and compatible to RFC
 * standards, and most IRC clients. libircclient features include:
 * - Full multi-threading support.
 * - Single threads handles all the IRC processing.
 * - Support for single-threaded applications, and socket-based applications,
 *   which use select()
 * - Synchronous and asynchronous interfaces.
 * - CTCP support with optional build-in reply code.
 * - Flexible DCC support, including both DCC chat, and DCC file transfer.
 * - Can both initiate and react to initiated DCC.
 * - Can accept or decline DCC sessions asynchronously.
 * - Plain C interface and implementation (possible to use from C++ code,
 *   obviously)
 * - Compatible with RFC 1459 and most IRC clients.
 * - Free, licensed under LGPL license.
 *
 * Note that to use libircclient, only libircclient.h should be included into your
 * program. Do not include other libirc_* headers.

 * letter, and reset by adding a minus sign before the letter.
 *
 * Here is the list of 'standard' channel modes:
 *
 * - \a o \a nickname - gives (+o nick) or takes (-o nick) the channel
 *      operator privileges from  a \a nickname. This mode affects the
 *      users in channel, not the channel itself.
 *      Examples: "+o tim", "-o watson".
 *
 * - \a p - sets (+p) or resets (-p) private channel flag.
 *      Private channels are shown in channel list as 'Prv', without the topic.
 *
 * - \a s - sets (+p) or resets (-p) secret channel flag.
 *      Secret channels aren't shown in channel list at all.
 *
 * - \a i - sets (+i) or resets (-i) invite-only channel flag. When the flag
 *      is set, only the people who are invited by irc_cmd_invite(), can
 *      join this channel.
 *
 * - \a t - sets (+t) or resets (-t) topic settable by channel operator only
 *      flag. When the flag is set, only the channel operators can change the
 *      channel topic.
 *
 * - \a n - sets (+n) or resets (-n) the protection from the clients outside
 *      the channel. When the \a +n mode is set, only the clients, who are in
 *      channel, can send the messages to the channel.
 *
 * - \a m - sets (+m) or resets (-m) the moderation of the channel. When the
 *      moderation mode is set, only channel operators and the users who have
 *      the \a +v user mode can speak in the channel.
 *
 * - \a v \a nickname - gives (+v nick) or takes (-v nick) from user the
 *      ability to speak on a moderated channel.
 *      Examples: "+v tim", "-v watson".
 *
 * - \a l \a number - sets (+l 20) or removes (-l) the restriction of maximum
 *      users in channel. When the restriction is set, and there is a number
 *      of users in the channel, no one can join the channel anymore.
 *
 * - \a k \a key - sets (+k secret) or removes (-k) the password from the
 *      channel. When the restriction is set, any user joining the channel
 *      required to provide a channel key.
 *
 * - \a b \a mask - sets (+b *!*@*.mil) or removes (-b *!*@*.mil) the ban mask
 *      on a user to keep him out of channel. Note that to remove the ban you
 *      must specify the ban mask to remove, not just "-b".

 *
 * The color system of libircclient is designed to be easy to use, and
 * portable between different IRC clients. Every color or format option is
 * described using plain text commands written between square brackets. The
 * possible codes are:
 * - [B] ... [/B] - bold format mode. Everything between [B] and [/B] is written in \b bold.
 * - [I] ... [/I] - italic/reverse format mode. Everything between [I] and [/I] is written in \c italic, or reversed (however, because some clients are incapable of rendering italic text, most clients display this as normal text with the background and foreground colors swapped).
 * - [U] ... [/U] - underline format mode. Everything between [U] and [/U] is written underlined.
 * - [COLOR=RED] ... [/COLOR] - write the text using specified foreground color. The color is set by using the \c COLOR keyword, and equal sign followed by text color code (see below).
 * - [COLOR=RED/BLUE] ... [/COLOR] - write the text using specified foreground and background color. The color is set by using the \c COLOR keyword, an equal sign followed by text foreground color code, a dash and a text background color code.
 *
 * The supported text colors are:
 * - WHITE
 * - BLACK
 * - DARKBLUE
 * - DARKGREEN
 * - RED
 * - BROWN
 * - PURPLE
 * - OLIVE
 * - YELLOW
 * - GREEN
 * - TEAL
 * - CYAN
 * - BLUE
 * - MAGENTA
 * - DARKGRAY
 * - LIGHTGRAY
 *
 * Examples of color sequences:
 * \code
 * Hello, [B]Tim[/B].
 * [U]Arsenal[/U] got a [COLOR=RED]red card[/COLOR]
 * The tree[U]s[/U] are [COLOR=GREEN/BLACK]green[/COLOR]
