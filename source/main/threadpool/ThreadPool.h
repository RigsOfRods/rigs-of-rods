/** \brief Facilitates execution of (small) tasks on separate threads.
 *
 * Implements a "rent-a-thread" model where each submitted task is assigned to one of several worker threads managed by the thread pool instance.
 * This is especially useful for short running tasks as it avoids the runtime cost of creating and launching a new thread. Notice, there
 * still is a certain overhead present due to the synchronization of threads required in the internal implementation.
 *
 * Usage example 1:
 * \code
 *  ThreadPool tp;
 *  auto task_handle = tp.RunTask([]{ SomeWork() };  // Start asynchronous task
 *  SomeOtherWork();
 *  task_handle.join(); // Wait for async task to finish
 * \endcode
 *
 * Usage example 2:
 * \code
 *  ThreadPool tp;
 *  auto task1 = []{ ... };
 *  auto task2 = std::bind(my_func, arg1, arg2);
 *  tp.Parallelize({task1, task2});  // Run tasks in parallel and wait until all have finished
 * \endcode
