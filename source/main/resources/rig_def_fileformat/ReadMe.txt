Truck file format (technical spec)
==================================

Truck is a human friendly text format created and used by Rigs of Rods (www.rigsofrods.org).
Find user documentation at http://docs.rigsofrods.org/vehicle-creation/fileformat-truck.

This spec applies to Rigs of Rods version 0.4.5 and further.
This spec covers all prior versions of the format: 1, 2, 3, 450 (discontinued)
See also 'fileformatversion'.

Syntax
------

The format is line-based. Empty lines and comments are skipped.

Lines starting with semicolon ";" or slash "/" (documented as '//') are comments.
Placing ';' or '/' anywhere else will not be considered a comment, but parsed as regular data!

Each line is treated as values separated by separators. 
Possible separators: space, tabulator, comma ",", colon ":" or pipe "|".
Multiple separators in a row (even if different from each other) are treated as one.

Element types
-------------

Title
    The first non-comment & non-empty of the file is a title. 

Inline-section
    Example: author.
    Has a keyword at start of line and data follow on the same line.
    Following lines do not belong to any section.

Block-section
    Example: nodes.
    Begins with a line containing nothing but a keyword.
    All subsequent lines belong to it until another
      section (any type) is encountered or module closed.
    Some may have special syntax, i.e. 'animators'              

Multiline-description
    Single instance: "description/end_description".
    Begins with a line containing nothing but "description".
    Ends with a line containing nothing but "end_description".
    All lines in between belong to it. Keywords inside it are ignored.
    <!> Subsequent lines belong to no section.
    
Multiline-comment
    Single instance: "comment/end_comment".
    Begins with a line containing nothing but "description".
    Ends with a line containing nothing but "end_description".
    All lines in between belong to it. Keywords inside it are ignored.
    <!> Can appear inside any block-section, does not affect it.

Directive
    Example: set_beam_defaults
    Consists of keyword at the beginning of the line and data on the same line.
    May perform various task, usualy set global attributes or change
      behavior of the parsing.
    Directive may appear in any block-section.

Modularity
----------

The elements can be grouped into modules. Each module must belong to one or more configurations.

Directives 'sectionconfig' specify truck configurations the user can choose from.
Exactly one must be selected. If none, the first defined is used.
Syntax: "sectionconfig <number - unused> <name>"

A module begins with keyword "section". Syntax:
  "section <n> <config> [<config> ...]"
  where <n> is unused number and config is a name specified in sectionconfig.
Module ends with keyword "end_section".

List of elements
----------------

Order is alphabetical, lettercase matches original docs (parsing is insensitive).

Compatibility
-------------

Existing content places a lot of compatibility constraints on the format:
* Modules (section/end_section) must support:
  - nodes2 with the same names in all modules (KickerRampV2.load)
  - managedmaterials, props, help, soundsources, flexbodies, videocamera
  - globals, author (many mods in archive - because of skins)
  - flares (archive: BBV.zip - BBV95.truck)
  - meshwheels, axles, commands2 (archive: Mercedess Actros 8x8_ampliroll.truck)
  - engine, engoption, torquecurve (archive: ple002_SuperBus.truck, RockHopper.truck)
  - //multiple sectionconfig names//(archive: ackermann_moving_trailer.zip)
  - contacters (Betzi-tourliner.zip)
  - TractionControl (archive: golf cart)
  - brakes, nodes (archive: Blue&White-ScaniaR470TL.truck)
  

Since RoR v0.4.5, all elements fully support named nodes.
In previous RoR versions, support was partial and undocumented.

Since RoR v0.4.5 the order of elements in truckfile doesn't matter.
The spawn process follows a pre-defined order of elements. 
Exceptions:
    add_animation (must be after section 'prop')
    flexbody_camera_mode (must be after section 'flexbody')
In previous versions, the order of elements defined the final result
and some combinations resulted in a crash.

Since v0.4.5, all elements can be modularized using 'section' keyword, except:
    author
    description
    disabledefaultsounds
    enable_advanced_deformation
    fileformatversion
    fileinfo
    forwardcommands
    guid
    hideInChooser
    importcommands
    lockgroup_default_nolock
    minimass
    rescuer
    rollon
In previous versions, this was undocumented.

Since v0.4.5, keyword 'sectionconfig' is no longer necessary and parser silently ignores it.
Modules are created as keyword 'section' is encountered.    

Since v0.4.5 sections 'nodes' and 'nodes2' both support named nodes.

Since v0.4.5 sections 'commands' & 'commands2' are unified.
The only difference is in compress & expand ratios.
Both support the same flags and can use multiple flags at once.

Since v0.4.5 subsection 'flexbodies'/'forset' supports named nodes.
However, ranges are only supported for nubered nodes.

Since v0.4.5 the 'end' keyword is no longer needed. Parser silently ignores it.
In previous versions, it was critical - without it, RoR crashed.

Since v0.4.5 the optional param 'wings/control_type' now has default 'n'
Old parser had no default, though the param is optional.

SPECIAL SYNTAXES
================

      

SECTION `FORSET`
----------------

Keyword: `forset`

Parsing as pseudocode:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    line.trim()
    IF (line == "forset"):  // Keyword "forset" alone
        abort("Invalid line.")
    line = line.substring(6) // Strip "forset"
    FOR EACH tok IN line.split(","): // Including empty strings
        IF tok.contains("-"):
            values = tok.split("-")
            node_a = 0;
            IF (values[0] == ""):
                node_a = values[0].to_uint();
            ADD_RANGE(node_a, values[1].to_uint())
        ELSE:
            ADD_NODE(tok.to_uint())
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All whitespace on the line is ignored. 
Int parsing: `std::strtoul()`, bad trailing chars are silently ignored.
Syntax: 
    1.  "forset" string (6 characters), no space at the end.
    2.  Items delimited by ",". On each side of each "," there is
        max 1 item. Empty/invalid string parses as node num `0`.
        Examples: "forset," -> 2 items `0`, "forset,," -> 3 items '0'
Acceptable item forms:
    *  Single node number (int >= 0): 123
    *  Node range (int >= 0): "123-456"
    *  Single node ID (string) 
Line containing only "forset" is skipped with warning.
When multiple nodes are separated just by space/tab, the 1st node
    is parsed, the others ignored: `forset1 2 3, 4` -> "1, 4"
When a node range has more than 2 nodes, they're ignored.
    `forset1-2-3,4-5-6` -> [1-2],[4-5]

Hyphen rules:
    * Item "---" (at least 1 hyphen) parse as [0]
    * Item "-1" parses as [0-1], "--1" and longer parse as `-1` and return
        value around  4294967286 (unsigned int overflow).
    * Item "1-" (any number of "-") parse as [1-0]
    Valid examples:
        
        `forset1-5, 10 - 20 ,roof123, 1 2,3 4, 1-2-3,4-5-6,-----,`
            -> [1-5],[10-20],[roof123],[1],[3],[1-2],[4-5],[0],[0]
        
        `forset 1-2-3 , 4-5-6,   -7,   8-,  -9-,          --10,  11--, 100`
            -> [1-2]  ,[4-5] ,[0-7],[8-0],[0-9],[0-4294967286],[11-0],[100]

        `forset6--,-66--,--66--,---6--,--7-, ---,7-`
            -> [6-0], [0-66], [0-4294967230],[0-0],[0-4294967289],[0-0],[7-0]
