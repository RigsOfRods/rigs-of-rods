================================================================================
    Softbody definition file format "Truck" specification
    Project Rigs of Rods (http://www.rigsofrods.org)
================================================================================

INTRO
=====

"Truck" is a human-friendly custom format for defining softbody game entities
- trucks, cars, boats, airplanes, loads and fixed objects.

VERSION
=======

This spec applies to Rigs of Rods version 0.4.5 and further.
This spec covers all prior versions of the format: 1, 2, 3, 450

SYNTAX
======

The format is line-based.

Lines starting with semicolon ";" or slash "/" are comments.
NOTE: The "/" comments were documented as "//", but the parser
only ever checked the first character.
IMPORTANT: Comments MUST be on separate line! Trailing comments are not supported. 

There are several syntaxes for parsing a line:

    Default
        The most usual and relaxed one
        Entire line is treated as values separated by separators. 
        Possible separators: space, tabulator, comma ",", colon ":" or pipe "|".
        Whitespace and "," are well known, others weren't documented as generic.
        Multiple separators in a row squash into one, i.e. this is a valid line:
        set_beam_defaults |,| -1 -1 ,,,,, -1, -1

    Keyword-space-CSV
        More complex sections
        Line consists of: keyword, space (separator), CSV (comma sep. values)
        The keyword is cut away, the rest is split along ",".

    Keyword-CSV
        Like above, except the space is optional.
    
    CSV
        Classic comma-separated-values. Only separator is ','
    
    CommaSpaceSV
        Separators are space or comma.

The format consists of these elements:

    Title
        The first line of the file is a title. 
	
    Inline-section
        Example: author.
        Has a keyword at start of line and data follow on the same line.
        Following lines do not belong to any section.

    Block-section
        Example: nodes.
        Begins with a line containing nothing but a keyword.
        All subsequent lines belong to it until another
          section (any type) is encountered or module closed.
          
    Animator-section
        Keyword: `animators`
        Works like block-section, except lines have special syntax.
        See chapter "SECTION ANIMATORS" for details.                

    Multiline-section
        Single instance: "description/end_description".
        Begins with a line containing nothing but "description".
        Ends with a line containing nothing but "end_description".
        All lines in between belong to it. Keywords inside it are ignored.
        Subsequent lines belong to no section.
    	
    Multiline-comment
        Single instance: "comment/end_comment".
        Begins with a line containing nothing but "description".
        Ends with a line containing nothing but "end_description".
        All lines in between belong to it. Keywords inside it are ignored.
        Can appear inside any block-section, does not affect it.

    Directive
        Example: set_beam_defaults
        Consists of keyword at the beginning of the line and data on the same line.
        May perform various task, usualy set global attributes or change
          behavior of the parsing.
        Directive may appear in any block-section.

    Module
        Begins with a line containing nothing but "section".
        Ends with a line containing nothing but "end_section".
        A chunk of file which represents an optional modification of the vehicle.
        See below for details.

COMPATIBILITY
=============

Since RoR v0.4.5, all elements fully support named nodes.
In previous RoR versions, support was partial and undocumented.

Since RoR v0.4.5 the order of elements in truckfile doesn't matter.
The spawn process follows a pre-defined order of elements. 
Exceptions:
    add_animation (must be after section 'prop')
    flexbody_camera_mode (must be after section 'flexbody')
In previous versions, the order of elements defined the final result
and some combinations resulted in a crash.

Since v0.4.5, all elements can be modularized using 'section' keyword, except:
    author
    description
    disabledefaultsounds
    enable_advanced_deformation
    fileformatversion
    fileinfo
    forwardcommands
    guid
    hideInChooser
    importcommands
    lockgroup_default_nolock
    minimass
    rescuer
    rollon
In previous versions, this was undocumented.

Since v0.4.5, keyword 'sectionconfig' is no longer necessary and parser silently ignores it.
Modules are created as keyword 'section' is encountered.    

Since v0.4.5 sections 'nodes' and 'nodes2' both support named nodes.

Since v0.4.5 sections 'commands' & 'commands2' are unified.
The only difference is in compress & expand ratios.
Both support the same flags and can use multiple flags at once.

Since v0.4.5 subsection 'flexbodies'/'forset' supports named nodes.
However, ranges are only supported for nubered nodes.

Since v0.4.5 the 'end' keyword is no longer needed. Parser silently ignores it.
In previous versions, it was critical - without it, RoR crashed.

Since v0.4.5 the optional param 'wings/control_type' now has default 'n'
Old parser had no default, though the param is optional.

SPECIAL SYNTAXES
================

SECTION ANIMATOR
----------------

All whitespace is ignored.
Args 0 - 2 are processed normally.
Arg 3 is split along "|", valid elements are (written as regexes):
    * /(throttle|rpm|aerotorq|aeropit|aerostatus)([12345678])/ ~ For example `throttle2`
    * /shortlimit[:]+([.]*)/ ~ Value should be real number, example: `shortlimit: 0.5`
    * /longlimit[:]+([.]*)/  ~ Value should be real number, example: `longlimit: 0.5`
    * KEYWORD:  vis,inv,airspeed,vvi,
                altimeter100k,altimeter10k,altimeter1k,
                aoa,flap,airbrake,roll,pitch,brakes,accel,clutch,
                speedo,tacho,turbo,parking,shifterman1,shifterman2,
                sequential,shifterlin,torque,difflock,
                rudderboat,throttleboat            

SECTION `FORSET`
----------------

Keyword: `forset`

Parsing as pseudocode:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    line.trim()
    IF (line == "forset"):  // Keyword "forset" alone
        abort("Invalid line.")
    line = line.substring(6) // Strip "forset"
    FOR EACH tok IN line.split(","): // Including empty strings
        IF tok.contains("-"):
            values = tok.split("-")
            node_a = 0;
            IF (values[0] == ""):
                node_a = values[0].to_uint();
            ADD_RANGE(node_a, values[1].to_uint())
        ELSE:
            ADD_NODE(tok.to_uint())
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All whitespace on the line is ignored. 
Int parsing: `std::strtoul()`, bad trailing chars are silently ignored.
Syntax: 
    1.  "forset" string (6 characters), no space at the end.
    2.  Items delimited by ",". On each side of each "," there is
        max 1 item. Empty/invalid string parses as node num `0`.
        Examples: "forset," -> 2 items `0`, "forset,," -> 3 items '0'
Acceptable item forms:
    *  Single node number (int >= 0): 123
    *  Node range (int >= 0): "123-456"
    *  Single node ID (string) 
Line containing only "forset" is skipped with warning.
When multiple nodes are separated just by space/tab, the 1st node
    is parsed, the others ignored: `forset1 2 3, 4` -> "1, 4"
When a node range has more than 2 nodes, they're ignored.
    `forset1-2-3,4-5-6` -> [1-2],[4-5]

Hyphen rules:
    * Item "---" (at least 1 hyphen) parse as [0]
    * Item "-1" parses as [0-1], "--1" and longer parse as `-1` and return
        value around  4294967286 (unsigned int overflow).
    * Item "1-" (any number of "-") parse as [1-0]
    Valid examples:
        
        `forset1-5, 10 - 20 ,roof123, 1 2,3 4, 1-2-3,4-5-6,-----,`
            -> [1-5],[10-20],[roof123],[1],[3],[1-2],[4-5],[0],[0]
        
        `forset 1-2-3 , 4-5-6,   -7,   8-,  -9-,          --10,  11--, 100`
            -> [1-2]  ,[4-5] ,[0-7],[8-0],[0-9],[0-4294967286],[11-0],[100]

        `forset6--,-66--,--66--,---6--,--7-, ---,7-`
            -> [6-0], [0-66], [0-4294967230],[0-0],[0-4294967289],[0-0],[7-0]
