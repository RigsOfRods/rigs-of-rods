Addons
======

Addons are AngelScript-powered feature packages for Rigs of Rods.

Addons are mods (ZIPs or directories under 
  'userprofile/Documents/My Games/Rigs of Rods/mods')
  with an INI-syntax config file '*.addon'.

All addons found during cache update are assembled under
  menu "Addons" in the console window (hotkey ~)
  with actions "Load" and "AutoLoad". 

An <.addon> file lists script file names (.as) 
  and entry points (script function names).
